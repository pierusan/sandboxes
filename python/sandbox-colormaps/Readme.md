  - "people did some user studies on a tool for diagnosing heart disease by
    looking at imaging of cells so these are doctors looking at patient data and
    of course the default in the tool they actually use every day is jet because
    it's the default color map and so that's what they're practiced at that's what
    if you ask them which color map they want to use they say oh yeah that one we
    like it it's colorful and stuff but if you measure their behavior compared to
    these better color maps over here they take twice as long and they make more
    diagnostic errors"
